[[_TOC_]]

Structure based on the [arc42](https://arc42.org/overview/) template.
I also reference terminology from [Simon Browns C4 model](https://c4model.com/), which I tag with `C4`.

# 1 Introduction and Goals

The Toy Robot Simulator is a simple command line tool which simulates a robot on a table top responding to basic movement and directional commands. It was built based on a task given during the Telstra Purple interview process.
There is no explicit context or long-term goal for this software. The assumption has been made that this is simply to demonstrate basic coding ability.

I include this architecture doc since it is a template I use for more complex applications and services. Even for simple tasks it can serve as a reminder not to skip over relevant parts, or to note why something has NOT been done.

# 2 Constraints

# 3 Context and Scope

There is no explicit context given other than the immediate requirements.

# 4 Solution Strategy

Without long-term vision or context, the strategy is to keep the solution as simple as possible.
